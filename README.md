# Xana
Xana is open-source language created on C#.
Our task was to make a programming language similar to Batch.
The language is designed to create various scripts.
The code was written in such a way that it was both understandable and more or less comfortable to analyze.
If you have questions about the programming language - inniesharpsoftware@gmail.com
